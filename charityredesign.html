         Chaldon Animal Sanctuary is a UK-based animal sanctuary providing lifelong care for cats and dogs with behavioral problems. Their website serves as a primary point of contact with potential donors, volunteers, and individuals interested in their work. However, the website may not be fully optimized for this purpose and there is a potential need to increase the user experience and functionality to enhance donations and engagement.

      <h2 class="title">Problem: Why was the Redesign needed?</h2>
      <p class="the-current-chaldon-animal-sanctuary-website-homepage">The current Chaldon Animal Sanctuary website struggles with inconsistencies in navigational and informational structure, compounded by a visually un-appealing design that fails to resonate with users. The website's poor aesthetic and structural flaws are evident in the varied success rates across different tasks in the usability testing, with some tasks showing significant user struggle to locate information or navigate to desired sections. These issues not only disrupt the user experience but also detract from the site's overall appeal, potentially impacting the Sanctuary's primary goal of increasing donations.</p>

          <p>During the heuristic analysis, the heuristic evaluation framework proposed by Neil Norman was employed. Error prevention measures seemed insufficient, as certain elements on the page could potentially lead to user errors or confusion. Additionally, inconsistencies were noticeable in terms of visual design, layout, and interaction patterns, which could hinder user comprehension. To enhance user experience, it would be beneficial to prioritize recognition-based design solutions that minimize the cognitive load and reliance on user memory, thereby facilitating smoother navigation and interaction on the homepage.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid chaldon-userpersona" src="./img/AffinityDiagram1.png" alt="">
        <p>We created an Affinity Diagram to analyse and synthesise the valuable insights gathered from our user testing interviews. It allowed us to identify patterns, themes, and commonalities in the feedback and responses provided by our interview participants.

          By collecting data and opinions, we gained a deep understanding of user needs, wants, and expectations:
          
          <ul> <li>Simple and clear donation process</li>
          
          <li>Cohesive brand, style and story</li>
          <li>Professional and authentic</li>
          </ul>
          These key insights from the affinity mapping process guided us in enhancing the user experience of Chaldon Animal Sanctuary's digital platform.

            <h4 class="the-current-chaldon-animal-sanctuary-website-homepage">Which features should we prioritise?</h4>
                <img class="img-fluid  chaldon-userpersona" src="./img/priortity2.png" alt="">
            <p>we utilized a feature prioritization matrix to gain key insights and make informed decisions.
              The feature prioritization matrix helped us assess and prioritize different features based on their importance and impact on the user experience. By evaluating each feature against criteria such as user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility, we were able to determine the most crucial elements to include in the design.
               </p>
               <h4 class="the-current-chaldon-animal-sanctuary-website-homepage">Empathy mapping</h4>
               <img class="img-fluid  chaldon-userpersona" src="./img/empathy1.png" alt="">
           <p>Using the data collected, I created an empathy map that visualize the user's perspective. 
            By analyzing the empathy map, I identified pain points, challenges, and frustrations that users experience throughout their journey. These pain points could be usability issues, complex workflows, lack of clarity, or any other obstacles hindering a seamless user experience.
        On the other side of the spectrum, I identified opportunities to create value and delight for users. These gain creators could be features, interactions, or services that enhance the user experience, exceed expectations, and fulfill user desires.
             Armed with these insights, we were readu to now design solutions that address the pain points and leverage the gain creators. We used a user-centered design approach, involving wireframing, prototyping, and iterative testing to refine the user experience and ensure it aligns with the users' needs and preferences.    
             This then assisted us to come up with our value proposition. </p>
            
          <h4 class="the-current-chaldon-animal-sanctuary-website-homepage">Competitor Analysis</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid  chaldon-userpersona" src="./img/competitor1.png" alt="">
      <p>To further understand our users, we carried out a competitor analysis. We examined two direct and indirect competitors and identified several issues they faced. These issues included controversial reputations, limited geographical reach in the UK compared to local sanctuaries, and negative experiences. This analysis highlighted the importance of authenticity and transparency in our approach.

        <p>Through user interviews and observations, I discovered that potential adopters like Sarah have a strong desire to make a positive impact on animal welfare through adoption and financial support. With this insight in mind, I crafted a user-centric design solution that prioritized ease of information access, intuitive navigation, and transparency regarding how donations are utilized.</p>
        <p>My approach focused on creating a seamless user experience that empowers individuals like Sarah to navigate the website effortlessly, explore available cats for adoption, and understand the sanctuary's work. By leveraging my expertise in UX/UI design, I strived to create a platform that not only meets the users' goals but also resonates with their aspirations.</p>
        <p>The user scenario that we had come up with was: <br> <b>
          <br>
          Jane wants to adopt a rescue cat. She is also considering making a donation to an animal sanctuary. She has heard about Chaldon Animal Sanctuary and decides to explore their website to learn more about their work, see available cats for adoption, and determine how her donation would be</b></p>
